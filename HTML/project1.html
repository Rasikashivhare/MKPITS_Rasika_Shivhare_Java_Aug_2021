            <p>Indian rhinoceros, (Rhinoceros unicornis), also called greater one-horned rhinoceros, the largest of
                the
                three Asian rhinoceroses. The Indian rhinoceros weighs between 1,800 and 2,700 kg (4,000 and 6,000
                pounds).
                It stands 2 metres (7 feet) high at the shoulder and is 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long. The Indian
                rhinoceros
                is more or less equivalent in size to the white rhinoceros of Africa and is distinguishable from the
                Javan
                rhinoceros by its greater size, the presence of a large horn, tubercles on its skin, and a different
                arrangement of skin folds. The Indian rhinoceros occupies the world’s tallest grasslands, where at
                the end
                of the summer monsoon in October grasses reach 7 metres (23 feet) tall. They are primarily grazers,
                except
                during the winter when they consume a larger proportion of browse. An Indian rhinoceros female will
                conceive
                again quickly if she loses her calf. Tigers kill about 10–20 percent of calves, but they rarely kill
                calves
                older than 1 year, so those Indian rhinoceroses that survive past that point are invulnerable to
                nonhuman
                predators. The Indian rhinoceros fights with its razor-sharp lower outer incisor teeth, not with its
                horn.
                Such teeth, or tusks, can reach 13 cm (5 inches) in length among dominant males and inflict lethal
                wounds on
                other males competing for access to breeding females. </p>
